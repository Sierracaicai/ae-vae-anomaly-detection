# ðŸ§ª Notebooks Overview

This folder contains all key stages of the anomaly detection project based on AE/VAE models.

Each notebook is organized to represent a specific phase of the project pipeline.

## ðŸ““ Notebook List

### `0_draft_experiments.ipynb`
- The very first draft version of this project.
- Includes initial data loading, simple AE/VAE models, and traditional method comparison.
- Retained for reference and idea evolution.

### `0_exploration_and_baseline.ipynb`
- A more structured and organized version of the original baseline.
- Contains:
  - Cleaned and labeled data import
  - Initial AE/VAE vs Isolation Forest/OcSVM performance comparison
  - Basic evaluation metrics
- Serves as the foundation for all future iterations.

### `1_data_analysis.ipynb` *(recommended next)*
- (To be created) Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature preprocessing.
- Output will feed into model training.

### `2_model_train_ae_vae.ipynb`
- (To be created) Final training of AE and VAE models with callbacks, checkpoints, and hyperparameter tuning.

### `3_explainability.ipynb`
- (To be created) Interpretability using SHAP or LIME to explain AE/VAE predictions.
